1 Arduino UNO R3.
1 TRRS circuit for audio output.
1 Headphone, Speaker.

Schematic so far:
4 potentiometers' analogs to analog pin A0, A1, A2, A3.
Power pin to 5V pin, GND to GND (lol).
Tip to pin 11.
Sleeve to pin GND.

# start
Copy the files into 'bitsynth' folder.

Open your Arduino IDE, download the `the_synth` library and `QuickStats` library
on the github link above to your Arduino IDE and include it by:
```
Sketch -> Import library... -> Add library...
```

Open the `bitsynth.ino` and upload it to your connected board.

Have not yet figured out its functionality so will update indepth details later!
